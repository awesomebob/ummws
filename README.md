Ubuntu Multiple Monitor Wallpaper Switcher

I wrote this primarily for myself, and have only tested it on my Ubuntu Gnome 15.04 Vivid distro.

I have this script attached to a shortcut key, but you could also have it check every few seconds if you wanted it to be more automatic.

Most of the code I found from this answer on the [Ask Ubuntu Stack Exchange](http://askubuntu.com/a/534589), but I modified it because I didn't need the imagemagick magic.

## How to Use
The python script expects to find 3 .png images in the same directory, named `1_screen.png`, `2_screens.png`, and `3_screens.png`.
You can modify this of course.
